Democratic Legitimacy in the Age of Population‑Scale Simulation

> **A legal‑technical framework to ensure that simulations used to justify public policy meet democratic standards of contestability and disclosure.**

---

## 📜 Overview

Governments increasingly rely on **population‑scale simulations** (digital twins, agent‑based models, scenario engines) to inform crisis responses—pandemics, financial instability, infrastructure failure, climate risk.

**Simulation itself is not the problem.**  
The problem arises when **coercive public policy is justified by simulations whose assumptions, objectives, and trade‑offs are not publicly examinable.**

This repository contains:
1. A **white paper** arguing for a narrow, defensible democratic principle.
2. A **model bill**—the *Algorithmic Governance Transparency and Democratic Justification Act*—ready for legislative adoption.
3. Supporting materials for implementation and advocacy.

## 🎯 Core Principle

> **When a simulation is used to justify public policy, it becomes a civic instrument and must meet democratic standards of contestability and disclosure.**

## ⚖️ Model Bill: Key Provisions

### **Section 3 – Disclosure Requirement**
No covered policy action may be justified by a population‑scale simulation unless the following is publicly disclosed:

- General purpose of the simulation
- Core assumptions materially affecting outcomes
- Stated objectives or optimization priorities
- Description of material trade‑offs encoded in the model
- Sensitivity ranges where outcomes change materially

Disclosure must be provided in **both** a technical summary and a plain‑language summary.

### **Section 4 – Simulation Registry**
A public registry must list all population‑scale simulations commissioned or materially relied upon in the **12 months preceding** a covered policy action.

### **Section 5 – Prohibition on Exclusive Reliance**
No policy may rely **exclusively or dominantly** on a simulation as its justification.

### **Section 6 – Emergency Exception & Post‑Enactment Review**
Disclosure may be delayed up to **180 days** in declared emergencies.  
After disclosure, a **public comment period** must be allowed for expert critique.

### **Section 7 – Legal Effect**
Policies enacted in violation lose **presumption of legitimacy** in judicial review.

🧠 Why This Matters

Simulation‑driven governance will expand, not recede.  
If democratic standards are **not established now**, opacity will become precedent, and precedent will become norm.

This framework does **not** attempt to stop simulation.  
It attempts to ensure **democracy survives it**.

## 🛡️ What This Framework Does **Not** Do

- Require source‑code disclosure
- Release real‑time operational data
- Abolish crisis modeling
- Compromise legitimate national security

It demands **contestability of justification**—not total transparency.

---

## 📈 Suitable Policy Domains

- Pandemic response mandates
- Economic stabilization measures
- Climate‑adaptation directives
- Infrastructure‑failure contingency plans
- Financial‑system interventions
